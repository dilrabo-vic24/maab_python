Success is not an overnight achievement.
It is the result of consistent effort over time.
Many people start something with great enthusiasm.
Only a few continue when challenges arise.
The key to achieving long-term goals is persistence and discipline.
Consider learning a new language.
At first, everything seems exciting and fresh.
As time goes on, grammar rules, vocabulary, and pronunciation become more challenging.
Those who practice daily, even if only for a few minutes, make noticeable progress.
Those who give up too soon never experience real improvement.
